Also this course covers many classic financial analytic methods:

1.Pandas Time Series Analysis Techniques

2.Stock Returns Analysis

3.Cumulative Daily Returns

4.Volatility and Securities Risk

10.Sharpe Ratio

11.Portfolio Allocation Optimization 

12.Efficient Frontier and Markowitz Optimization

13.Capital Asset Pricing Model

14.Stock Splits and Dividends

15.Efficient Market Hypothesis

And finally, it teaches how to implement the above algorithms and fit them into Quantopian.
